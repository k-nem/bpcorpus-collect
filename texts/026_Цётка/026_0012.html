<p>I would have played much, but now all my strength goes,</p>
<p>And string after lyre-string is breaking,</p>
<p>Although valiant song is not yet in its death-throes</p>
<p>And thought after thought is awaking.</p>
<p>I would have played much, but death says 'Hold!' to me,</p>
<p>For the grave it would bid me make ready.</p>
<p>Ah, strings, ye may break then, what harm can it do me?</p>
<p>In the grave we shall lie down together!</p>
<p>Maybe from this lyre there will grow a green willow,</p>
<p>And from the snapped strings snowy flowers,</p>
<p>Maybe in its shadow will come to play children,</p>
<p>Joyfully through the spring hours.</p>
<p>And, maybe, then, one of those children will whittle</p>
<p>A flute, grandchild to the lost lyre,</p>
<p>And will play on it so the whole earth hears its ditty</p>
<p>And knows it my echo sincere.</p>
<p>And the strings of the grandfather, untimely broken,</p>
<p>Shall chime out like bell-notes resounding,</p>
<p>And the songs that its lifespan had left half-unspoken</p>
<p>In its scion yield harvest abounding,</p>
<p>And, on All Souls' Night, below the dark willow</p>
<p>Will the living word echo forth truly,</p>
<p>And the song with a thousandfold strength shall peal, thrilling,</p>
<p>And my lyre shall live again newly.</p>
